## Installation
### A. Remote theme method

By using `jekyll-remote-theme` your repo would have remote access to the content of these folders:

- `assets`
- `_layouts`
- `_includes`
- `_sass`

This method allows you to get updates easily

#### Fresh start

Create a Github account, go to [chulapa-101 repo](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa-101), fork it and quickstart your site!

#### Migrate

You can migrate an existing page adding this line to your `_config.yml` and make sure to remove any previous theme or remote theme parameter:
  
```yaml
remote_theme: dieghernan/chulapa

... more config options
```
    

### B. Fork the base repository [Advance users only]

You can fork [the base repo](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa/generate) and modify it. However, the site would be frozen at the moment of forking and it would make harder for you to get potential new features and upgrades.

The minimal files and folders you need are:
 
- `assets`
- `_layouts`
- `_includes`
- `_sass`
- `Gemfile`
- `_config.yml`

Sample `_config` file [here](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa/blob/master/_config.yml).

## Configuration and Layouts
